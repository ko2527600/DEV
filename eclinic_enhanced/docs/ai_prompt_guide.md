Patient Input: [PATIENT_SYMPTOMS]

Please provide:
1. General information about the reported symptoms
2. Possible common causes (non-diagnostic)
3. Self-care suggestions if appropriate
4. Urgency level (Low, Medium, High, Emergency)
5. Clear recommendation to consult a healthcare provider

Format your response in a clear, easy-to-understand manner.
```

### Medical Chatbot Prompt

```
You are a helpful medical assistant for the eClinic platform. 
You help patients with general health questions, appointment booking, and platform navigation.

CAPABILITIES:
- Answer general health and wellness questions
- Help with appointment booking process
- Provide medication information (general, not personalized)
- Explain medical procedures and tests
- Guide users through the platform features

LIMITATIONS:
- Cannot provide medical diagnoses
- Cannot prescribe medications

```

### Appointment Triage Prompt

```
You are an AI triage assistant helping to prioritize patient appointments based on symptoms and urgency.

Analyze the following appointment request and provide:
1. Urgency Level (1-5, where 5 is emergency)
2. Recommended Timeframe (Same day, Within 3 days, Within 1 week, Routine)
3. Suggested Specialist (if applicable)
4. Additional Information Needed

Patient Information:
- Age: [AGE]
- Symptoms: [SYMPTOMS]
- Duration: [DURATION]
- Previous Medical History: [HISTORY]

Provide your assessment in JSON format for easy integration.
```

## Firebase Integration

### Setting Up AI Functions

Create Firebase Cloud Functions to handle AI API calls securely:

```javascript
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require('openai');

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: functions.config().openai.key,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

exports.analyzeSymptoms = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // Verify user authentication
  if (!context.auth) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('unauthenticated', 'User must be authenticated');
  }

  const { symptoms, age, gender } = data;
  
  const prompt = `Analyze these symptoms for a ${age}-year-old ${gender}: ${symptoms}`;
  
  try {
    const response = await openai.createCompletion({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      prompt: prompt,
      max_tokens: 500,
      temperature: 0.3,
    });
    
    return { analysis: response.data.choices[0].text };
  } catch (error) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('internal', 'AI analysis failed');
  }
});
```

### Data Storage for AI Features

Store AI interactions and results in Firestore:

```javascript
// AI Consultation Collection Structure
{
  userId: "user_id",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  type: "symptom_check", // or "chatbot", "triage"
  input: {
    symptoms: "headache, fever, fatigue",
    duration: "2 days",
    severity: "moderate"
  },
  aiResponse: {
    urgency: "medium",
    recommendations: ["rest", "hydration", "monitor temperature"],
    followUp: "consult_doctor_if_worsens"
  },
  followUpActions: {
    appointmentBooked: false,
    doctorConsulted: false
  }
}
```

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection

1. **Encryption**: Encrypt all health data in transit and at rest
2. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access to AI features
3. **Audit Logging**: Track all AI interactions for compliance
4. **Data Minimization**: Only send necessary data to AI services

### HIPAA Compliance

When implementing AI features in healthcare applications:

- Use HIPAA-compliant AI services
- Implement Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)
- Ensure data anonymization when possible
- Maintain detailed audit trails
- Provide patient consent mechanisms

### API Security

```javascript
// Example secure API call
const makeSecureAICall = async (patientData) => {
  // Remove identifying information
  const anonymizedData = {
    age: patientData.age,
    symptoms: patientData.symptoms,
    // Remove name, ID, specific dates
  };
  
  // Make API call with anonymized data
  const response = await openai.createCompletion({
    // ... configuration
  });
  
  return response;
};
```
