# App Requirements and Core Features

## 1. Core Features

Based on the analysis of TikTok's success and user engagement patterns, the proposed social media application will incorporate the following core features, designed to provide a compelling and engaging user experience:

### 1.1. Short-Form Video Creation and Sharing

This is the foundational element of the application, mirroring TikTok's primary functionality. Users will be able to:

*   **Record and Upload:** Capture new videos directly within the app using the device's camera, or upload existing video content from their gallery. Support for various video resolutions and aspect ratios will be implemented, with a strong emphasis on vertical video format.
*   **Video Length:** Videos will be limited to a maximum duration of 10 minutes, with an optimal length for engagement being between 15 and 60 seconds. This encourages concise and impactful content creation.
*   **Basic Editing Tools:** An intuitive in-app editor will provide essential functionalities:
    *   **Trimming and Cropping:** Users can easily adjust the start and end points of their videos and crop them to desired dimensions.
    *   **Speed Control:** Options to slow down or speed up video segments for creative effects.
    *   **Volume Adjustment:** Control over original audio volume and added sound elements.

### 1.2. Rich Content Enhancement Tools

To empower creativity and content diversity, the app will offer a comprehensive suite of enhancement tools:

*   **Extensive Music and Sound Library:** A curated and constantly updated library of trending music, sound effects, and original audio clips. Users will also have the ability to extract audio from other public videos on the platform for their own creations, fostering viral trends.
*   **Dynamic Filters and Effects:** A wide range of visual filters, augmented reality (AR) effects, and transition effects to enhance video aesthetics and storytelling. These will be regularly updated to keep pace with user preferences and trends.
*   **Text Overlays and Stickers:** Customizable text options with various fonts, colors, and animations. A diverse collection of animated and static stickers will be available to add personality and context to videos.
*   **Voice-over and Sound Mixing:** Users can record their own voice-overs and mix them with background music or original video audio, allowing for narrative depth and commentary.

### 1.3. Personalized Content Discovery (For You Page - FYP)

The 


heart of the app's engagement will be its highly personalized 'For You Page' (FYP). This algorithmic feed will present users with a continuous stream of relevant and engaging videos, even from creators they don't follow. The FYP will be driven by:

*   **Advanced Recommendation Engine:** Utilizing machine learning models to analyze user interactions (likes, comments, shares, watch time, re-watches), content characteristics (audio, visual elements, hashtags), and trending topics to deliver a unique and constantly evolving feed for each user.
*   **Content Diversity:** The algorithm will be designed to balance personalization with content diversity, introducing users to new creators and genres to prevent filter bubbles.
*   **Seamless Scrolling:** An infinite scroll mechanism will ensure a smooth and uninterrupted content consumption experience.

### 1.4. Robust Social Interaction Features

To foster a vibrant community, the app will include comprehensive social interaction functionalities:

*   **Like, Comment, and Share:** Standard social media interactions allowing users to express appreciation, engage in discussions, and share content with friends both within and outside the platform.
*   **Duet and Stitch:** These highly popular features from TikTok will be implemented, enabling users to create new videos using existing content from other creators. Duet allows users to create a video alongside another video, while Stitch enables users to clip and integrate scenes from another video into their own.
*   **Direct Messaging:** A private messaging system for one-on-one or group conversations, facilitating direct communication between users.
*   **Follow/Unfollow:** Standard social graph functionality allowing users to build their personalized feed of content from creators they admire.

### 1.5. User Profiles and Content Management

Each user will have a dedicated profile to manage their presence and content:

*   **Personalized Profile Page:** Displays user's uploaded videos, liked videos, follower/following counts, and a customizable bio and profile picture.
*   **Drafts:** Users can save unfinished video creations as drafts to continue editing later.
*   **Privacy Settings:** Granular control over who can view their content, comment on their videos, and interact with them.

### 1.6. Search and Discovery Tools

Beyond the FYP, users will have tools to actively discover content:

*   **Keyword Search:** Search for videos, users, sounds, and hashtags using keywords.
*   **Trending Hashtags and Sounds:** Dedicated sections showcasing currently trending topics and audio, encouraging participation in viral phenomena.

### 1.7. Live Streaming (Tiered Access)

To further enhance engagement and creator monetization, live streaming capabilities will be introduced:

*   **Real-time Interaction:** Creators can broadcast live videos and interact with their audience through live chat and virtual gifts.
*   **Monetization:** Viewers can send virtual gifts to creators during live streams, which can be converted into real currency.
*   **Eligibility:** Live streaming access will be tiered, requiring creators to meet certain criteria (e.g., follower count, content quality) to ensure a positive and moderated environment.

### 1.8. Monetization Features for Creators

To attract and retain creators, the app will offer various monetization avenues:

*   **Creator Fund/Program:** A program to directly compensate eligible creators based on their content's performance and engagement.
*   **In-App Gifting:** Viewers can purchase and send virtual gifts to their favorite creators, both during live streams and on regular videos.
*   **Brand Partnerships/Marketplace:** Facilitating connections between brands and creators for sponsored content opportunities.

## 2. User Roles and Permissions

The application will support the following primary user roles:

*   **Guest User:** Can browse public content (FYP, trending), but cannot create content, like, comment, follow, or use direct messaging. Requires registration to unlock full features.
*   **Registered User (Standard):** Can create, upload, edit, and share videos; like, comment, and share other users' content; follow/unfollow; use direct messaging; and manage their profile.
*   **Creator (Verified/Eligible):** A subset of Registered Users who meet specific criteria (e.g., follower count, consistent content creation, adherence to community guidelines). They gain access to advanced features such as live streaming, creator analytics, and monetization programs.
*   **Administrator:** Internal role with full control over content moderation, user management, system settings, and analytics. (Not a user-facing role).

Permissions will be granular, allowing users to control their privacy settings, such as who can view their profile, comment on their videos, or send them direct messages.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

To ensure a robust, scalable, and secure application, the following non-functional requirements will be prioritized:

### 3.1. Scalability

The architecture must be designed to handle a massive and rapidly growing user base and content volume. This includes:
