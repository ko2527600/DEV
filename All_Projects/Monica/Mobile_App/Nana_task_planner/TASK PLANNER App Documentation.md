*   **Due Date:** A calendar picker allows users to select a specific date and, optionally, a time for task completion.
*   **Priority Level:** A dropdown or selection mechanism to assign a priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low, Urgent).
*   **Tags/Categories:** (If implemented) Users can assign relevant tags or categories to tasks for better organization and filtering.

Once a task is created, it can be easily edited at any time. Users can click or tap on an existing task to open an editing interface, where all the aforementioned fields can be modified. Changes are saved instantly or upon explicit confirmation, ensuring that task details are always up-to-date.

### Task Status Management

TASK PLANNER provides clear mechanisms for managing the lifecycle of a task. Each task typically progresses through various states, such as:

*   **To-Do:** The initial state for newly created tasks.
*   **In Progress:** Indicates that work on the task has begun.
*   **Completed:** Marks a task as finished. Completed tasks are often archived or moved to a separate view.
*   **On Hold:** (Optional) For tasks that are temporarily paused.
*   **Cancelled:** (Optional) For tasks that will no longer be pursued.

Users can easily change the status of a task through intuitive controls, such as checkboxes for completion, drag-and-drop interfaces in Kanban boards, or status dropdowns within task details. This visual feedback helps users track their progress and manage their workload effectively.

### Search and Filtering Mechanisms

As the number of tasks grows, efficient search and filtering become crucial. TASK PLANNER incorporates robust mechanisms to help users quickly locate specific tasks:

*   **Search Bar:** A prominent search bar allows users to type keywords to find tasks by title or description.
*   **Filter Options:** Users can apply various filters to narrow down their task list. Common filter criteria include:
    *   **Status:** Show only 'To-Do', 'Completed', or 'In Progress' tasks.
    *   **Priority:** Display tasks with a specific priority level.
    *   **Due Date:** Filter tasks due today, this week, or within a custom date range.
    *   **Tags/Categories:** Show tasks belonging to specific categories.
    *   **Assigned To:** (For collaborative versions) Filter tasks assigned to a particular team member.
*   **Sorting Options:** Tasks can be sorted by criteria such as due date (ascending/descending), priority, creation date, or alphabetical order.

These combined search and filtering capabilities empower users to maintain a clear overview of their tasks, regardless of the volume.

### Data Synchronization across Devices

A critical feature of TASK PLANNER is its seamless data synchronization across all user devices (web and mobile). This is primarily facilitated by Supabase's real-time capabilities and robust database infrastructure. When a user makes a change on one device, that change is almost instantaneously reflected on all other logged-in devices. This ensures data consistency and provides a continuous, uninterrupted workflow, allowing users to switch between their web browser and mobile app without losing context or encountering outdated information.




## 5. Technical Architecture

The TASK PLANNER application is built on a modern, scalable architecture that leverages the power of Supabase as its backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the technical components, their interactions, and the overall system design.

### Overall System Architecture

The TASK PLANNER application follows a client-server architecture with multiple client applications (web and mobile) communicating with a centralized backend powered by Supabase. The architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure.

The system consists of three primary layers:

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

Security policies ensure users can only access their own data:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on tasks table
ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can only see their own tasks
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own tasks" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy: Users can only insert tasks for themselves
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own tasks" ON tasks
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy: Users can only update their own tasks
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own tasks" ON tasks
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy: Users can only delete their own tasks
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own tasks" ON tasks
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Example API Calls

#### Creating a New Task

```javascript
// Using Supabase JavaScript client
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('tasks')
  .insert([
    {
      title: 'Review quarterly reports',
      description: 'Analyze Q4 performance metrics and prepare summary',
      due_date: '2024-01-20T17:00:00Z',
      priority: 'high',
      category_id: 'uuid-of-work-category',
      tags: ['review', 'quarterly', 'reports']
    }
  ])
  .select();

if (error) {
  console.error('Error creating task:', error);
} else {
  console.log('Task created:', data);
}
```

#### Fetching Tasks with Filtering

```javascript
// Get high priority tasks due this week
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('tasks')
  .select(`
    *,
    categories (
      name,
      color
    )
  `)
  .eq('priority', 'high')
  .gte('due_date', new Date().toISOString())
  .lte('due_date', new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString())
  .order('due_date', { ascending: true });
```

#### Updating Task Status

```javascript
// Mark task as completed
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('tasks')
  .update({ 
    status: 'completed',
    completed_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('id', taskId)
  .select();
```

#### Real-time Subscriptions

```javascript
// Subscribe to task changes
const subscription = supabase
  .channel('tasks')
  .on('postgres_changes', 
    { 
      event: '*', 
      schema: 'public', 
      table: 'tasks',
      filter: `user_id=eq.${userId}`
    }, 
    (payload) => {
      console.log('Task change received:', payload);
      // Update UI accordingly
      handleTaskChange(payload);
    }
  )
  .subscribe();

// Unsubscribe when component unmounts
const unsubscribe = () => {
  supabase.removeChannel(subscription);
};
```

### Error Handling

All API responses follow consistent error formatting:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid input",
    "details": "Title field is required",
    "hint": "Provide a non-empty title for the task",
    "code": "23502"
  }
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `201`: Created
- `400`: Bad Request
- `401`: Unauthorized
- `403`: Forbidden
- `404`: Not Found
- `409`: Conflict
- `422`: Unprocessable Entity
- `500`: Internal Server Error

### Rate Limiting and Performance

Supabase implements automatic rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- **Anonymous requests:** 30 requests per hour
- **Authenticated requests:** 100 requests per minute
- **Bulk operations:** Limited to 1000 records per request

Performance optimization recommendations:
- Use `select` parameter to fetch only required columns
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Utilize database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Cache frequently accessed data on the client side
- Use real-time subscriptions judiciously to avoid unnecessary network traffic
